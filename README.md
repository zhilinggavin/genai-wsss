# Gernative-based Weakly Supervised Senmantic Segmentation
This repository contains a deep learning project with structured code, data handling, and experiments.

## Dataset
This project includes three datasets.

1. **In-house - Australia Dataset**:

    **Raw**: This dataset comprises Chest HRCT scans from 227 patients and includes cases of fibrosis. No annotation or lables.

    **Processed**: 

    - Pre-processing pipeline: yingying completed
    - Filter Selection: Only contains slices bewteen top and end slices of lung. The top and last slices are selected based on a minimum lung area of XXX(to be checked: 100) pixels.

2. **In-house - OSIC Firbosis Dataset**
3. **Open Souce - Kits23 Dataset**
    contains kidney, tumour, etc... Masks for each elements.
